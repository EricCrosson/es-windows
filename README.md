Each number/letter represents an emacs window.
Windows followed by H or V, are internal Horizontal or Vertical splitters.
The last window is an external window, showing this buffer.
Type the number/letter of the window you want, followed by
^, >, v, <, in which case the window will be split in that direction
or RET, in which case the window itself will be used.

To prevent this message from showing, set `esw/help-message' to `nil'
